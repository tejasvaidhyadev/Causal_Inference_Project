Unofficial repository for the the paper ["Counterfactual Invariance to Spurious Correlations: Why and How to Pass Stress Tests"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.00545.pdf) 

# Generate Datasets
gen_dataset only supports generating synthetic datasets for now.  
Although I have added script for generating real datasets, it is not yet tested. checkout for ```induce_dependence.py``` for more details.

# Training
Added to version of trainer script. Use pytorch_trainer.py for training with pytorch and tensorflow_trainer.py for training with tensorflow.
Note: pytorch_trainer.py is more feature rich and is recommended.

# Warning
The code is not yet ready for public use. We are working on it.
Do not use it unless you know what you are doing.
