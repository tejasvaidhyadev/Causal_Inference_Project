# Generate Datasets
gen_dataset only supports generating synthetic datasets for now. Although I have added script for generating real datasets, it is not yet ready for use. checkout for induce_dependence.py for more details.

# Warning
The code is not yet ready for public use. We are working on it.
Do not use it unless you know what you are doing.
